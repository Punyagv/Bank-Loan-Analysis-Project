# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project

Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze and monitor the lending activities and performance of our bank through a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. The report provides insights into key loan-related metrics and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making to track the health of our loan portfolio and inform lending strategies. The analysis is conducted using Microsoft Excel for data extraction and visualizations. The raw data for this analysis is sourced from "Data Tutorials" YouTube channel.
